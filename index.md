1. Rule-based attribution
Rule-based attribution models allocate conversion credit to marketing channels using predefined, deterministic rules. These models do not learn from data but instead follow fixed logic to assign credit across customer touchpoints.
1. First-touch attribution assigns 100% of the conversion credit to the first marketing channel through which the user interacted with the brand, emphasizing the channel responsible for initial customer acquisition.
2. Last-touch attribution assigns 100% of the conversion credit to the final marketing channel encountered before conversion, highlighting the channel that directly led to the purchase.
3. Markov chain-based attribution is a data-driven, probabilistic model that represents customer journeys as a sequence of state transitions between marketing channels. Channel importance is measured using the removal effect, which estimates the decrease in conversion probability when a channel is removed from the journey.

Conclusions- First-touch attribution indicates that organic search is a critical acquisition channel, responsible for initiating a significant portion of customer journeys. This highlights the importance of SEO and organic visibility in driving awareness.

Last-touch attribution suggests that direct traffic is the primary conversion closer, reflecting high brand familiarity and user intent at the time of purchase. Direct traffic does not necessarily represent a marketing effort but rather the absence of referrer data, often indicating returning or loyal users.

Linear attribution emphasizes the multi-touch nature of customer journeys, showing that awareness, consideration, and conversion channels collectively contribute to revenue generation.

direct / none (highest removal effect)
Removing Direct reduces conversion probability by ~70%
This shows Direct is structurally critical, not just last-touch dominant
➡️ Indicates:
Returning users
Brand trust
Strong loyalty loop

🔹 Google / organic (second highest)
Removing Organic causes a significant drop in conversions
Confirms Organic is a true driver, not just an early touch
➡️ Indicates:
SEO is foundational to the funnel
Organic brings high-quality users who eventually convert

🔹 Paid channels (Google / cpc, dfa / cpm)
Lower but non-zero removal effects
Act as an assist and reinforcement channel
➡️ Indicates:
Paid ads support intent and remarketing
Not the primary funnel drivers
